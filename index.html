            <h2>Editorial Principles</h2></a>
            <p>​</p>
            <p>Accuracy</p>
            <p>Investopedia presents accurate and dependable information in all forms whether that be analysis, education, advice or anything in between. The content is reviewed by multiple editors and experts to meet its high standards with particular attention paid to formulas, facts, figures and examples.</p>
            <p>Transparency</p>
            <p>Investopedia is very clear to the readers about its sources of information and the context in which the information was obtained. It frequently sources other publications, books, reports or other media in collecting the information presented to the readers, but, ultimately, the content is produced by the expert editors and writers of Investopedia, and is not crowd-sourced. Content that is created in collaboration with an advertiser will be clearly labeled as sponsored and presented as such. Investopedia takes full responsibility for its content. </p>
            <p>Insightful</p>
            <p>Investopedia strives to provide unique and valuable insights to the readers. By simplifying the complex and demystifying financial jargon Investopedia can educate its readers about finance and investing in a way that leads them to making smarter decisions.</p>

         <p>Two of its features that I use most frequently are <i><u>dictionary</u></i> and <i><u> video definitions </u></i>.</p>
        
         <p>You can go to the <strong> dictionary </strong> to look up the financial terms with which you are not familiar. All the terms are arranged alphabetically.</p>
         
          <p><img src='my%20images/dictionary.png' alt='' /></p>   
         
         <p>Some of the most important financial, business, and economic concepts have their own <strong> video definitions </strong> where the terms are thoroughly explained with detailed examples. </p>
